Diagnostic scanner that dumps every field EspBleBluedroid extracts from each advertisement: address and address type, RSSI, connectable/scannable flags, name, every advertised service UUID, the service data, and the manufacturer data as hex. iBeacon payloads are decoded into UUID / major / minor / measured power. Use it to see what a peripheral actually advertises before writing a scan filter, or to debug why `advertisesService()` does not match.

## Hardware

- 1 × original ESP32 running this sketch (central)
- Any nearby BLE devices to inspect

## What it does

- Runs a continuous active scan (scan responses included, so more devices show their name)
- Prints one line per advertisement with all extracted fields
- Decodes manufacturer data that matches the iBeacon layout (Apple company ID `0x004C`)
- Send `q` to print the diagnostic counters (`droppedScanResults` / `droppedEvents`)
- Send `d` to toggle duplicate reporting and rescan

## Key APIs

- `EspBleScanResult` — `address`, `addressType`, `rssi`, `connectable`, `scannable`, `name`, `serviceUuids[]` / `serviceUuidCount`, `manufacturerData`, `serviceData[]` / `serviceDataCount`, `appearance`, `txPowerLevel`
- `scanResult.hasName()` / `hasManufacturerData()` / `hasServiceData()` / `hasAppearance()` / `hasTxPowerLevel()`
- `espBleDecodeIBeacon()` from `EspBleIBeacon.h` — decode an iBeacon manufacturer-data payload
- `EspBleScanConfig::wantDuplicates` — false reports each device once; true reports every advertisement received
- `bluetooth.scanner().droppedResultCount()` — scan results lost to queue overflow
- `bluetooth.droppedEventCount()` — connection events lost to queue overflow

## Duplicate reporting

By default (`wantDuplicates = false`) **each device is reported only once**. A device keeps re-broadcasting, but repeats are dropped, which keeps a survey of nearby devices readable.

The catch is that **a device whose payload keeps changing only shows its first value**. To follow a sensor beacon's readings, enable duplicate reporting with `d`. The setting applies when a scan starts, so toggling it restarts the scan for you.

```
Scanning. duplicates=off
(a device updating its Service Data every 5 s is still reported once)

Scanning. duplicates=on
(every update arrives)
```

## Differences from EspBle

| | EspBle | EspBleBluedroid |
|---|---|---|
| Fields available on `EspBleScanResult` | name, UUIDs, service data, manufacturer data, appearance, Tx Power, connectable / scannable | identical |
| Advertising and scan response | reported as one merged result | identical from the sketch's point of view, but the **merge is done by the library**: Bluedroid raises one event per PDU, so results for the same address are held briefly and joined |
| Result queue | bounded, `droppedResultCount()` | 16 entries, `droppedResultCount()` |
| Classic device discovery | — | separate operation and result type ([Classic/Inquiry](../../Classic/Inquiry/)) |

**How to port:** no code change.
