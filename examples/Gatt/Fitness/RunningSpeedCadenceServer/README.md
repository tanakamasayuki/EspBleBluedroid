Standard Running Speed and Cadence Service (0x1814) peripheral. RSC Measurement (0x2A53) is notified with instantaneous speed and cadence plus optional stride length and total distance; RSC Feature (0x2A54) and Sensor Location (0x2A5D) are readable.

## Hardware

- 1 × original ESP32 running this sketch (peripheral)
- 1 × central: the [RunningSpeedCadenceClient](../RunningSpeedCadenceClient/) example, or any RSC collector

## What it does

- Registers the RSC service and advertises 0x1814
- Publishes RSC Feature = Stride + Distance (0x0003) and Sensor Location = In Shoe (2) as readable values
- Every second, notifies a 10-byte RSC Measurement (flags 0x03) at 3.0 m/s, cadence 180, stride 1.25 m, and a growing total distance (+3.0 m)

## Key APIs

- `bluetooth.gattServer().addCharacteristic(..., { .notifiable = true })` — RSC Measurement
- `bluetooth.gattServer().setValue(...)` — seed the readable Feature / Sensor Location
- `bluetooth.gattServer().notify(...)` — push each measurement to subscribers

## Notes

- Speed is in 1/256 m/s units, stride length in 1/100 m, and total distance in 1/10 m. Flags bit 2 (walking/running) is left 0, so the reading is reported as walking.

## Expected Serial output

```
The server is silent; observe values on the client.
